                <span class="footnote-biblio">1. <em class="push-tad-right">National Geographic.</em> http://www.nationalgeographic.com/roper2006/pdf/FINALReport2006GeogLitsurvey.pdf. May, 2006</span>
                <span class="annotation border-bot">This study is a thorough investigation of the quality of American geography literacy.  Published in May of 2006, it gives us a very useful set of statistics that are metrics of how much geographical and geopolitical education American children are receiving from our education system.  It provides a host of statistics on students from the ages of 18-24 to see how much knowledge they have accumulated (or forgotten) since starting kindergarten.</span>
                <span class="footnote-biblio">2. <em class="push-tad-right">The Newsroom.</em> Season 1 Episode 1, Opening Speech. June 24, 2012</span>
                <span class="annotation border-bot">From a current TV Show (a rather political one), this speech is about the state of affairs in general in America.  While the quote, "The first step in solving any problem is realizing there is one," is intended to show a lacking effort of American youth to be involved in our civil society more broadly, it thoroughly applies to education specifically because of education's inherent intervention in all matters that relate to the civil sphere.</span>
                <span class="footnote-biblio">3. <em class="push-tad-right">Real Clear Politics.</em> http://http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/latest_polls. November, 2015</span>
                <span class="annotation border-bot">Real Clear Politics is the defacto hub where any analyst can go to see an amalgamation of all polls published in the US relating to matters of national and state elections.  They are updated many times a day as new polls come in and create a running list of all polls taken.  It creates a set of historical data for easy comparison of current circumstance with historical circumstances that one can use to assess trends in primary and general elections at the state and national levels.</span>
                <span class="footnote-biblio">4. <em class="push-tad-right">CBS News.</em> http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ben-carson-compares-syrian-refugees-to-rabid-dogs-calls-for-more-u-s-vetting. November 19, 2015</span>
                <span class="annotation border-bot">This articles discusses Ben Carson, a leading Republican presidential candidate, whom likened Syrian refugees to rabid dogs when being interviewed.  He was having a discussion about the refugee crisis in Europe and the more specific issue about whether or not the US should participate in allowing refugees into America, and if so, how many.  This is a very useful quote because it gives us a specific view into the emotions and thoughts of a leading presidential candidate in a candid way that allows us to more easily decide whom should be running our country in the 2016 presidential election.</span>
                <span class="footnote-biblio">5. <em class="push-tad-right">Real Clear Politics.</em> http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/us/politics/donald-trump-runs-for-president-this-time-for-real-he-says.html. June 16, 2015</span>
                <span class="annotation border-bot">This article is much in the same vein as the previous article.  It shows a specific candid quote by a leading presidential candidate that allows us to come to a more informed decision about whom to vote for in US elections.  This time it was Donald Trump, the leading Republican presidential candidate claiming that Mexico has been sending rapists across the southern border of the US.</span>
                <span class="footnote-biblio">6. <em class="push-tad-right">Pew Forum.</em> http://www.pewforum.org/2009/10/07/mapping-the-global-muslim-population. October 7, 2009</span>
                <span class="annotation border-bot">This is the main article I have used to help us understand the Muslim world.  It specifically lays out many statistics about differences within the Muslim world, from religion, to ethnicity, to language, to national origin.  It is the main basis of my article's thesis: the idea that the Muslim world is much more complicated than many Americans believe it to be.  This is a fabulous study that describes and shows in detail how diverse and broad the Muslim population of our planet is.</span>
